#' Update all the .osm.pbf files saved in a directory
#'
#' This function is used to re-download all `.osm.pbf` files stored in
#' `download_directory` that were firstly downloaded through [oe_get()]. See
#' Details.
#'
#' @param download_directory Character string of the path of the directory
#'   where the `.osm.pbf` files are saved.
#' @param quiet Boolean. If `FALSE` the function prints informative
#'   messages. See Details.
#' @param delete_gpkg Boolean. if `TRUE` the function deletes the old `.gpkg`
#'   files. We added this parameter to minimize the probability of accidentally
#'   reading-in old and not-synchronized `.gpkg` files. See Details. Defaults to
#'   `TRUE`.
#' @param max_file_size The maximum file size to download without asking in
#'   interactive mode. Default: `5e+8`, half a gigabyte.
#' @param ... Additional parameter that will be passed to [oe_get()] (such as
#'   `stringsAsFactors` or `query`).
#'
#' @details This function is used to re-download `.osm.pbf` files that are
#'   stored in a directory (specified by `download_directory` param) and that
#'   were firstly downloaded through [oe_get()] . The name of the files must
#'   begin with the name of one of the supported providers (see
#'   [oe_providers()]) and it must end with `.osm.pbf`. All other
#'   files in the directory that do not match this format are ignored.
#'
#'   The process for re-downloading the `.osm.pbf` files is performed using the
#'   function [oe_get()] . The appropriate provider is determined by looking at
#'   the first word in the path of the `.osm.pbf` file. The place is determined
#'   by looking at the second word in the file path and the matching is
#'   performed through the `id` column in the provider's database. So, for
#'   example, the path `geofabrik_italy-latest-update.osm.pbf` will be matched
#'   with the provider `"geofabrik"` and the geographical zone `italy` through
#'   the column `id` in `geofabrik_zones`.
#'
#'   The parameter `delete_gpkg` is used to delete all `.gpkg` files in
#'   `download_directory`. We decided to set its default value to `TRUE` to
#'   minimize the possibility of reading-in old and non-synchronized `.gpkg`
#'   files. If you set `delete_gpkg = FALSE`, then you need to manually
#'   reconvert all files using [oe_get()] or [oe_vectortranslate()] .
#'
#'   If you set the parameter `quiet` to `FALSE`, then the function will print
#'   some useful messages regarding the characteristics of the files before and
#'   after updating them. More precisely, it will print the output of the
#'   columns `size`, `mtime` and `ctime` from [file.info()]. Please note that
#'   the meaning of `mtime` and `ctime` depends on the OS and the file system.
#'   Check [file.info()].
#'
#' @return The path(s) of the `.osm.pbf` file(s) that were updated.
