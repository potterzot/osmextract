#' Get the location of files
#'
#' This function takes a `place` name and it returns the path of `.pbf` and
#' `.gpkg` files associated with it.
#'
#' @details The matching between the existing files (saved in a directory
#'   specified by `download_directory` parameter) and the input `place` is
#'   performed using `list.files`, setting a pattern equal to the basename of
#'   the URL associated to the input `place`. For example, if you specify
#'   `place = "Isle of Wight"`, then the input `place` is matched with a URL of
#'   a `.osm.pbf` file (via [`oe_match()`]) and the matching is performed setting a
#'   pattern equal to the basename of that URL.
#'
#'   If there is no file in `download_directory` that can be matched with the
#'   basename and `download_if_missing` parameter is equal to `TRUE`, then the
#'   function tries to download and translate a new file from the chosen
#'   provider (`geofabrik` is the default provider). If `download_if_missing`
#'   parameter is equal to `FALSE` (default value), then the function stops with
#'   an error.
#'
#' @param download_directory Directory where the files downloaded by osmextract
#'   are stored. By default it is equal to [`oe_download_directory()`].
#' @param download_if_missing Attempt to download the file if it cannot be
#'   found? `FALSE` by default.
#' @param ... Extra arguments that are passed to [`oe_match()`] and [`oe_get()`].
#'   Please note that you cannot modify the argument `download_only`.
